## Project Overview  
The **Greendata Solution** project involves cleaning and analyzing a dataset to uncover insights related to demographics, employment status, credit scores, health conditions, and more. The project utilizes tools such as Excel and Tableau for data cleaning and visualization. This repository showcases the data preparation process, insights gained, and visualizations created.  

---

## Objectives  
- Clean and preprocess raw data to ensure accuracy and consistency.  
- Visualize key metrics and trends to identify actionable insights.  
- Provide recommendations for data-driven decision-making.  

---

## Tools Used  
- **Excel**: Data cleaning, preprocessing, and standardization.  
- **Tableau**: Dashboard creation and visualization of insights.  

---

## Data Cleaning Process  
1. **Handling Missing and Inconsistent Data**:  
   - Replaced missing values in the "Age" column with the median age of the dataset.  
   - Corrected negative and inconsistent salary values, converting them to numeric format.  
   - Standardized categorical columns like "Health Condition" and "Employment Status."  

2. **Date Standardization**:  
   - Reformatted admission dates to ISO standard format (YYYY-MM-DD).  

3. **Text Standardization**:  
   - Ensured consistent capitalization of names and city names.  
   - Replaced blank spaces in categorical columns with "Unknown."  

4. **Data Type Validation**:  
   - Converted age, salary, and credit scores to numeric data types.  
   - Validated and corrected date columns to proper date types.  

5. **Duplicate Handling**:  
   - Identified and removed duplicate entries based on unique IDs.

## Key Insights  
- Cities like Atlanta have a higher representation in the dataset, which could influence trends.  
- Individuals with higher education levels tend to have better salaries and credit scores.  
- Health conditions and blood types show specific correlations that can be explored further.  

---

## Recommendations  
- Address data inconsistencies in future data collection processes to improve data quality.  
- Focus on cities with fewer records to identify gaps in demographic representation.  
- Use the insights from health and blood type correlations for targeted health campaigns.
